That way you do not have to rely on an internal implementation detail.

This way it will not trigger that regardless the number of layers per DN, because that is also based on a layer count. (Unless we use a value that on the very save side, like 50.) _  _ I have considered expert info, but this way it looks like the "[truncated]" message for long strings in the tree pane. Long strings (like cookies in HTTP) are not flagged with expert info. So I think this is more consistent.

That way the depth detail can be kept internal to packet.c, and it is easier to explain when things go wrong. _  _ For example, during presentations you could note that no filters will be available for DN past the limit.

And a significant difference compared to truncated strings. Now I am in doubt if we should add expert info because of this (or is having the filter tls.handshake.dnames_truncated enough?). _  _ Having a fixed limit is indeed easier to explain and document. Normally I try avoid having multiple constant values that have a correlation. _ I did some digging. In the sample pcap the average is 4,55 and the list starts with the DNs with the lowest number of RDNs. That appears to be the normal order. A limit of 100 is a nice round number and allows for just below 5 (= PINFO_LAYER_MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH / 100) RDNs per DN on average. _ So that should be high enough to normally not hit this limit and low enough not hit the 500 layers DISSECTOR_ASSERT.
